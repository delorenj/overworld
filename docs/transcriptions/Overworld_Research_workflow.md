**Jarad** *[00:02]*: I need to create a workflow like this. I'm going to describe something. Now when I say I need a workflow, I want you to pay attention to the thought process and disassociate from like the underlying thing that I'm trying to figure out. Because I'm just going to explain my process of how I would solve the problem. And what I want is a workflow that's modeled after whatever I'm doing, whatever I'm going to demonstrate. And it should be called something like proof of concept or, you know, investigative proof of concept. So starting here, I need to get this 2D project view drawn. But to do that I need some way to draw 2D elements and animate them programmatically. And I don't know how to do that. So I want to. I thought what would be really helpful is if I had a toolkit. 
**Jarad** *[01:14]*: If I develop a toolkit where I can say, draw a line and draw this, or even better, I can give an SVG as a parameter and it will give you, give me back a rendered 2D view. And then I thought maybe Play Canvas will be good. So I'm going to investigate Play Canvas. Now, I don't know if play canvas does 2D. I know it does 3D. So you have to investigate how does it do 2D if it doesn't do 2D. We can do 3D with a fully orthogonal view, like a top down, completely orthogonal. You won't be able to tell the difference. So you know what I'm saying? Like either 2D drawing, it's supported, or 3D with orthogonal. And then I would maybe make one single example of it working, Maybe draw a line. 
**Jarad** *[02:00]*: See if you can draw a line and give it different texture, different. Different styles, different colors. And that would be the proof of concept. So how would I codify that into a workflow?
