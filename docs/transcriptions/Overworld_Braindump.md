**Jarad** *[00:00]*: This is a brain dump for a PRD of a new product I thought of called Overworld. And what it will do is take a product roadmap or an implementation plan or any kind of linear. And I'm guessing I don't want to lock it down to linear because if you have, let's say, three parallel components to be implemented, I could see instead of a road, they would be islands. But the idea is to map a document like a roadmap or a. 
**Jarad** *[01:00]*: Or. 
**Jarad** *[01:00]*: A implementation plan or something, to map that to a stylized overworld map. So that's the basic idea. The input is a document, a markdown document or a PDF that is already divided into logical parts. I guess that's the abstract way. The complete abstraction is a document that has been subdivided into a hierarchy of tasks or checkpoints. That's the input. And the output is a beautiful stylized overworld map that is reminiscent of the 8 bit and 16 bit overworld map era. You know, colorful representation, not always to scale, and it's themed consistently for the game. Right. So Super Mario Brothers 3 overworld map has, you know, the same kind of palette for the background of the map with little icons that represent the pipes and the plants and the castles. 
**Jarad** *[02:28]*: So same thing, but for the project that we're on and the next section of this talk, that was the intro, the next section is going to be how I envision we can break this task down because it's not trivial. It's. It's not trivial because we have stylized, which means there's no structure, it's not structured. For instance, if you show a really beautiful stylized overworld map, there's not a deterministic way to say, oh, this is the road, this is background, this is an icon. So the first step is going to be to turn the idea of the map to a stylized but structured way. All right, so yeah, that's the next section. So section two begins now. All right, so this is how I picture. I picture a multi agent architecture and I'm going to talk about each of the agents. 
**Jarad** *[03:41]*: And this is not final. This is just a brain dump. But I picture the first step would be to kick off the process and have an artist do a couple, you know, first draft ideas that the human user can vote or pick. So it would be a stylized but inaccurate, probably inaccurate misspellings. And it's not going to be in order, it's just going to be the look and feel. So once we have an artist give back a look and feel in the form of A png. We'll pick one and use that as the base. So then the next step will be to, I would say the first, the most important part is to create the road. And it's just going to be a matter of how it's going to wind and wiggle and the color texture of the road with no information on it. 
**Jarad** *[05:02]*: And then I would picture marking the coordinates of that road. We gotta mark the. 
**Jarad** *[05:11]*: So it's gonna take these image. 
**Jarad** *[05:17]*: And. 
**Jarad** *[05:18]*: Iterate on it and then turn the image into structured data. So it's going to figure out the coordinates or something. Some way it's going to mark where the road is. And the only thing that's important about the road is the graphic behind it and to know where, like what vicinity to place icon markers. All right, so that's why we have this coordinate spline. Or maybe that's what we need. Maybe, maybe what we're going to generate is a spline that fits, you know, a vector spline that fits the roadmap. And then we have a scatter plot along the spline, a scatter plot with some threshold of, you know, distance from the spline of where to place icons. And the spline equation needs to be able to say which dots come before or after each other. So if it was a linear. 
**Jarad** *[06:32]*: If it was linear, obviously then, you know, it's a function of time. And now that we have this nonlinear spline, it's not as trivial, but it still can be treated one to one as a line that has coordinates where one coordinate will always be greater than or less than or equal to all in the same, you know what I'm saying? So that's what's important here. So step one is getting the base art and then generating that spline, generating the scatter plot. And then maybe an MVP would be just showing circles with numbers along their scatter plot of where we put different milestones. So we would have like milestone 1, 2, 3 and it would divide it up amongst the whole line. So the 0 would be the first dot and a 1.0 would be the end of the dot. 
**Jarad** *[07:45]*: And it would divide them up evenly amongst all of them. And that would be a good mvp. That's enough to get. Now what I'm thinking.
